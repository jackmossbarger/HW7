This web form is a generic survey a company could use to acquire super generic info about Uiowa students.

For this page I went with a black font on white page because it really is the easiets thing to see, and since college kids are taking this survey you got to assume that they will be drunk so its very easy to see for that reason. It also has some requird fields and auto focus which really helps college kids know what parts they need to fill out. 

It also has super cool features such as drop down boxes, this is a really easy way to ask students which year of school they are in since you can only be one and not multiple. I also have the question "do you like iowa" as question where you can tick multiple boxs and thats because you can have many different feelings about a state.

On the first page there is a cool feature that gives hint text which gives users a little help in knowing what they should put in the box. It also has required fields which will not let the user move on to the next page until they complete that box. All of these features are really cool!





The thank you page is awesome because it has a cool iowa picture, and everyone loves iowa.
